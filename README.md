# Portfolio Goals and Philosophy
Author: Justin R. Wong

The goal of any portfolio manager is to outperform the benchmark. Benchmarks can be SPY, DJI, or other index funds that track the overall economy.

"Outperformance" typically means having a higher inflation-adjusted return, but in the world of finance, outperforamnce could also be in terms of risk-adjusted returns, which isn't necessarily the same as maximimum returns.

I believe outperformance should also account for time and attention spend managing portfolio, in addition to overall inflation-adjusted return and risk-adjusted return.

## Questions that shaped my definition of "outperformance"
 - Is it REALLY worth your time, effort, and attention to be spending X% of your time for Y% return that beats your benchamrk by Z%?
 - Does that Z% difference make a significnat enough difference in your quality of life and health?
 - What's the point of achieving higher returns if you don't have the time to enjoy those returns?
 - Would be have gotten more satisfaction/enjoyment in life by using that time elsewhere like with family, friends, other projects, traveling, other life experiences etc.?
 - (Υ * Value) = (Χ * time) * (Ζ * effort). Something is worth your time only if you get more value out of it than you put in. This pretty much applies to everything. An extra 10 hours folloing stock news won't necessarily translate to 1% more return.

## On Cash (USD) Positions
In bear markets, cash is king. In bull markets, cash is trash. When inflation is high, find somewhere to run.

Inflation is simply buying power of consumers. So if a portfolio returns the same rate as inflation, the return has real returns of zero. Nothing fundamentally changed about quality of life or perception of wealth.

This means sitting cash will always be suboptimal if inflation is positive (which it most likely is). Instead of cash, prefer money market funds, income funds, bonds, or cash equivalents to match inflation-adjusted return.

## On Risk-on Assets
Risk-on assets are scary for people who have never invested because of the fear of losing hard-earned money. The book "Psychology of Money" by Morgan Housel has many chapters explaining why risk tolerance varies across different individuals, which essentially boils down to how someone's environment shaped their life from early on. 

You simply can not have returns without risk. They're two sides of the same coin because

## Reflecting on my investing journey since 2017
In high school, I worked summer jobs purely for the work experience and I didn't like having to ask my parents for money. I grew up hearing stories from friends how they had to help pay their family's bills and always considered myself very fortunate for not needing to do that. As a way to show appreciation, I promsed myself that I'd never become a materialistic person (though I might buy things for sentimental/milestone reasons). Nevertheless, with my part time job money, I saved up enough to buy my very own macbook pro laptop with my own funds with the intention of getting into coding, games, and explore whatever the internet had to offer.

Since I didn't care to buy jordans or supreme gear, I didn't really know what to do with the money I had saved up. I didn't care to go to the mall or watch movies with friends and I ate at home with my family every night anyways, so overall spending was low. But I knew I wanted to grow my wealth. In the summer of 2017, my dad helped me open up a brokerage account for me to deposit my money in. He said I could start learning to invest and exploring the world of finance. Fast forward to August 2017 first stock I owned was AAPL and AMZN. I flipped it for 10% within 2 months and though I was so good at this that I could continue going about.

From that point on, I've checked my portfolio at least once a week for the past 8+ years. I looked at my portfolio religiously as often as I'd go to the gym. I've spent hours learning about options strategies, read almost every page on Investopedia, and watched videos/clips on legendary investors like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch, the latest finance news, and company conviction videos.

I started out picking high quality companies. With a drive for higher returns, I became quite degenerate with picking penny stocks, SPACs, options(day trading, leaps, and swings). With drawdowns being too high, I switched to DCA-ing into index funds (SPY), while focused on other parts of my life.

As of 2025, I'm now employing various strategies:
- using webull's dynamic buys to DCA into high quality stocks I believe in
- buying SWPPX (Schwab's SPY mutual fund) every Wednesday
- holding high conviction long term shares of companies I believe will impact that world for the better (TSLA, GOOG, MSFT, NVDA, PLTR, SOFI, AMD)
- slightly shorter term high conviction shares in MSTR, IBIT, and other crypto assets
- LEAP and swing options using bull put spreads, synthetic covered calls, and vertical spreads.
- high income yield ETFs like MSTY, NVDY, TSLY as an alternative to cash positions

In the past 8 years with regular contributions, I've grown my overall portfolio from measly low 4-digits to mid 6 digits and will only go higher. Part of the experience along this journey has included:
- massive wins and massive losses
- positions literally going to zero
- positions returning 500%
- companies I've held get delisted from NYSE and onto OTC markets
- companies I've held went through stock splits and reverse stock splits
- participating in ESPP (employee stock purchase program)
- learning how to look at a balance sheet and analyzing company fundamentals

Through all these experiences, I've always looked at risk as a potential for more reward, and reward only, with the assumption that I have time to recover from major losses. This has treated me well on occasion, but I'm turning to a new chapter in my investing life where I was to optimize for risk-adjusted returns on a better balanced portfolio that outperforms the benchmark through inflation-adjusted returns and attention/time spent.

Going forward, my goal is to take more holistic approach based on my definition of "outperformance".  This means allowing money to grow and compound, while allocating a certain % to bet on high conviction, assymetric risks with high expected returns. This means concentrating on only a handful of plays instead of chasing around smaller returns that simply aren't worth my time.

Having that said, I also want to do a better job at documenting my learnings to continue reflecting on how far I've come and share out my experiences.

# Learnings

## Lessons
- cut losses quickly
- always hace a plan when entering a trade
- don't get in a trade unless you're willing to double down or you're willing to gamble
- bull markets are easy to make money, bear markets is where the strongest make it out
- stay away from leverage and margin until you know what you're doing
- always know your maximum risk
- prices always return to their
- "money go up" is a bold assumption
- everything is a portfolio. it's only your responsibility to maximize it.

## Risk and Return Metrics

## [Beta](https://www.fidelity.com/insights/investing-ideas/glossary-beta#:~:text=BETA%3F-,Beta%20is%20the%20measure%20of%20the%20risk%20or%20volatility%20of,expected%20return%20of%20an%20asset.)
Beta is a measure for volatility comparison.
```
An exchange-traded fund, or ETF, with a beta of 0.65 is 35 percent less volatile than the market.
```

## [Sharpe Ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/010815/what-difference-between-sharpe-ratio-and-traynor-ratio.asp)
Sharpe Ratio (SR) is a measure for risk-adjusted return. Since the denominator is standard deviation of a portfolio, SR penalizes both upside and downside volatility. In many high growth companies, downside volatility could be too sensitive because of quarter-over-quarter price movements, which should be rightfully penalized especially if a company is not meeting investor expectations.

The upside movement, however, should be rewarded.

## [Treynor Ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treynorratio.asp)
Treynoy Ratio is also a measure for risk-adjusted return. Since the denominator is Beta, TR penalizes downside volatilty only. When Beta is up, TR may go down

### Treynor vs Sharpe Ratio
The Sharpe ratio helps investors understand an investment's return compared to its risk while the Treynor ratio explores the excess return generated for each unit of risk in a portfolio.

## [Calmar Ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calmarratio.asp)
Calmar Ratio is function of the fund's average compounded annual rate of return versus its maximum drawdown.

The higher the Calmar ratio, the better it performed on a risk-adjusted basis during the given time frame, which is mostly commonly set at 36 months.

## [Kurtosis](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data-science/kurtosis/#:~:text=What%20is%20Excess%20Kurtosis%3F,Excess%20Kurtosis%20%3D%20Kurtosis%20%E2%80%93%203)
Kurtosis is a statistical measure that defines how heavily the tails of a distribution differ from the tails of a normal distribution. In other words, kurtosis identifies whether the tails of a given distribution contain extreme values.

### Types of Kurtosis
The types of kurtosis are determined by the excess kurtosis of a particular distribution. The excess kurtosis can take positive or negative values, as well as values close to zero.

#### 1. Mesokurtic
Data that follows a mesokurtic distribution shows an excess kurtosis of zero or close to zero. This means that if the data follows a normal distribution, it follows a mesokurtic distribution.

#### 2. Leptokurtic
Leptokurtic indicates a positive excess kurtosis. The leptokurtic distribution shows heavy tails on either side, indicating large outliers. In finance, a leptokurtic distribution shows that the investment returns may be prone to extreme values on either side. Therefore, an investment whose returns follow a leptokurtic distribution is considered to be risky.

#### 3. Platykurtic
A platykurtic distribution shows a negative excess kurtosis. The kurtosis reveals a distribution with flat tails. The flat tails indicate the small outliers in a distribution. In the finance context, the platykurtic distribution of the investment returns is desirable for investors because there is a small probability that the investment would experience extreme returns.
